      <p>Hey there! My name is Calvin and I will tell you a little bit about me in this page and how I got here. I have recently joined a coding bootcamp to gain a unique set of skills. I have never imagined myself to start coding and actually be interested in it until I stumbled across a random advertisement on the web. At this very moment I questioned myself and wondered what it would be like to learn code and what kind of oppurtunities it would open up for me in the future. This may have been the turning point in my life, as I have searched for something to be interested in all my years of school.

      <p>I didnt think much of it at first but I told myself it wouldnt hurt to sign up and apply for this. More or less, I signed up for "fun" and didnt think much else about it. At this point in time I signed up for a bunch of different things including jobs but later was becoming more uninterested as the spam calls started rolling in. I started ignoring every call and voicemail. I began regretting my decision to put my info out there and wondered why I even bothered signing up to all these things. However, one day I opened up my phone to see a voicemail on my phone and just decided to check it out and clear it as I did with the other ones. Upon opening up this voicemail it struck me that it was from the bootcamp that I had applied to not long ago and its the first and last time I have ever heard from them. I was about 4 days late on getting to this voicemail but I decided to call back and kill some time to learn about this program. I dialed the number that was given to me and was greeted by a kind fellow. I never imagined myself to sink into a conversation with this person, but I did. And for more than a hour, we talked and went on and on about the program. I have never gotten so interested in something and what I thought would be a quick 10 minute talk, had ended up to being close to a 2 hour conversation. I instantly wanted more and wanted to begin the next step in this program.
